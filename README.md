As of February 2017, Ramblr's features include:

- Account creation, user authentication, and guest account login.

- Main page containing:

    - A feed of posts by followed users,
    - A nav bar containing the site logo, a link back to the main page, account name and icon for the logged-in user, and a logout button,
    - A secondary nav bar with links to the forms listed below.
    - A sidebar of recommended blogs.

- Post creation. Post types include:

  - Text posts
  - Photo posts
  - Video posts
  - Quote posts
  - Link posts
  - Audio posts

  Forms for creating each type of post are linked on the secondary nav bar on the main page.

- Following / unfollowing other users. Following or unfollowing a user refreshes the feed so it contains (or removes) posts by the followed/unfollowed user. Icons to follow or unfollow users are located next to their usernames.

- Liking / unliking posts.

- Post editing.

- Individual user pages (visited by clicking on usernames on individual posts / usernames on the sidebar).
